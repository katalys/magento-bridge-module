* **Use Cron**: This flag controls whether the plugin uses a stateful background table to track tasks. Using the cron system is suggested as it can improve your website's performance.

## Verifying Installation
The plugin adds a snippet of JavaScript to your web pages. This snippet enables Katalys to attribute orders to its affiliates.

To verify the plugin has been installed and the appropriate Magento caches have been cleared, look at the source code of any public page -- we suggest simply starting with the homepage. The process to view a page's source is slightly different depending on which browser you're using, but most offer an option of "View Page Source" when right-clicking on the page.

Within the source of the page, you should see a JavaScript snippet as indicated in this screenshot.
